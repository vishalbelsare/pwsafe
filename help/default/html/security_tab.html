<h2>Security Tab</h2>

<img alt="security tab" src="images/options/security_tab.jpg">

<p>The Security Tab provides access to user controlled security
settings.</p>

<h3>Clear clipboard upon minimize</h3>

<p>When checked, the program clears clipboard contents of any stored
data (such as a password) when the application is minimized.
This prevents anyone else or any other program from reading the
contents of the clipboard. Note that selecting this option with the
"Copy password to clipboard, and then immediately minimize" double click
action in the <a href="misc_tab.html">Misc Options tab</a> will lead to
unexpected results (the password will be copied, but immediately cleared).</p>

<h3>Clear clipboard upon exit</h3>

<p>When checked, the program clears clipboard contents of any stored
data (such as a password) when the interface is minimized or closed.
This prevents anyone else or any other program from reading the
contents of the clipboard.</p>

<h3>Exclude from clipboard history</h3>

<p>When checked (default), items that <b>Password Safe</b> place on the clipboard (such as passwords) are <b>not</b> include in the clipboard history,
in systems where this feature is supported (Windows 10 and later).
By unchecking this, you're potentially exposing your passwords to anyone who can access your clipboard history.</p>

<h3>Confirm item copy to clipboard</h3>

<p>When checked, a prompt is displayed requesting user confirmation
every time a password is copied from the database to the clipboard.</p>

<h3>'Browse to URL' copies password to clipboard</h3>
<p>It's useful to have the password ready for pasting when browsing to a website's login page. However, this can be considered a security risk, since you didn't explicitly copy the password.
If you check this, the relevant password will be copied to your clipboard when browsing to the URL specified in the entry.</p>

<h3>Exclude from screen capture</h3>
<p>One possible security risk is someone surreptitiously capturing your screen when <b>Password Safe</b> is open. Even if you don't have a password displayed, the other information in an entry or the main window can be of use to an attacker.
    Starting with version 3.64, <b>Password Safe</b> protects against this by hiding the application from Windows' screen capture feature.
    If you wish to disable this feature, e.g., for taking a screenshot to report a problem, you can do so by clearing this checkbox.

</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>This feature is only supported on Windows 10 Version 2004 and later.</li>
    <li>Some programs, such as remote desktop viewers and screen readers for the visually impaired, rely on the screen capture capability to function. If you're using such programs on a regular basis, you might want to disable this.
        See also the <a href="cli.html">Command Line Arguments</a> page.</li>
    <li>When enabled, a small green icon is displayed in the main window's status bar, and in the master password entry dialog.</li>
    <li>When disabled, the icon will be displayed in yellow.</li>
    <li>When overridden by the command line argument, the icon will be displayed in red.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Database locking</h3>

<p> When the database is locked due to one of the events
below, the database is saved, and then all its data is cleared from
memory. However, the undo/redo log is retained so that changes can be
undone (or redone) after unlocking.  Note: all entry information in these
commands remain encrypted in memory.</p> 

<ul>
<li><b>Lock password database on minimized</b><br>

<p>When checked, the program locks the password database when the application is
minimized. When maximized again for use, a password is required to
access the database.</p>

<li><b>Lock password database on workstation lock</b><br>

<p>Checking this causes the password database to lock when the
workstation is locked preventing unauthorized access by users that may
have access to the workstation.</p>

<li><b>Lock password database after....</b><br>

<p>Checking this option and setting a time causes <b>Password Safe</b>
to lock the password database after the set interval has passed without
user actions in the application.</p>
</ul>

<h3>'Browse to URL' copies password to clipboard</h3>

<p>By default, <b>Password Safe</b> copies the entry's password to the clipboard
when the user selects the 'Browse to URL' action so that it is ready
to paste into the required field.  However, many web sites now require
other information or no information (e.g., a search engine). by deselecting
this option, <b>Password Safe</b> will no longer paste anything into the
clipboard during this action.</p>

<h3>Unlock Difficulty</h3>

<p>The setting of the slider determines how much processing is required to open and save
a <b>Password Safe</b> database. The <em>Standard</em> setting should provide sufficient security without
delaying the opening of a database significantly on most platforms. When increasing this value, consider
the slowest CPU that you will use to access the database.</p>

<p><b>Password Safe</b> uses the <!-- [V4Format:] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> -->
original <a href="http://www.schneier.com/paper-low-entropy.pdf">Key
Stretching</a> algorithm published by Bruce Schneier, which expands the 
password to contain more entropy to make it significantly harder to
employ brute-force processing. The slider sets the number of iterations
of the stretching, between 2048 and 2<sup><small>22</small></sup>.</p>
